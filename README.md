# Description

This project was developed for my summer internship in Prof. Arno Solin's Machine Learning Research group. The project's goal was to compare various methods for approximate inference in Bayesian Neural Networks, such as Variatonal Inference methods (ADVI, MFVI), MCMC samplers (HMC, NUTS), Laplace approximation and Ensemble of NNs . This would be thenused to discover principles that dictate how different design choices of BNNs affect the approximation quality of the posterior with respect to the various methods, and assess the efficacy of these methods for uncertainty quantification.
